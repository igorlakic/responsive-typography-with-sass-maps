# Responsive typography with Sass maps

This is a Sass mixin for easier management of responsive typography. You can read more about it on my website: mosaicwebsites.com/blog/responsive-typography-with-sass-maps

## How to:

Just place "responsive-typography-sass-maps-mixin.scss" somewhere in your project. If you're using SMACSS, PaternLab or some other convention or system, then place it where you would normally place styles for text elements.
